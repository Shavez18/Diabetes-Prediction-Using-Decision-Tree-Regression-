# 🩺 Diabetes Prediction Using Decision Tree (Regression)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project implements a **Decision Tree Regressor** to predict diabetes progression based on patient health data. Using the **Scikit-learn Diabetes Dataset**, we explore data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization to understand how different features contribute to diabetes prediction.  

The project aims to showcase the application of machine learning in healthcare analytics and demonstrate regression modeling for medical data.

## 📊 Dataset
We used the **Diabetes Dataset** from Scikit-learn:
- **Number of samples:** 442  
- **Features:** 10 baseline variables (age, sex, BMI, blood pressure, and six blood serum measurements)  
- **Target:** Quantitative measure of disease progression one year after baseline

## ⚙️ Tech Stack
- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **Libraries:**  
  - `scikit-learn` – Model & dataset  
  - `pandas` – Data handling  
  - `numpy` – Numerical operations  
  - `matplotlib` / `seaborn` – Visualization

## 🚀 Implementation Steps
1. **Load the dataset** using Scikit-learn  
2. **Explore dataset features** and understand medical relevance  
3. **Split data** into training and testing sets  
4. **Train Decision Tree Regressor**  
5. **Evaluate model performance** using metrics (MSE, R²)  
6. **Visualize results** (feature importance, predictions vs. actual values)
